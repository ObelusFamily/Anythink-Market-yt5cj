To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

So first thingâ€™s first [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Verify install with following commands.
`docker -v`
`docker-compose -v`

Next run `docker-compose up` from the project root directory

Lets test the backend is running, point your browser to
[http://localhost:3000/api/ping](http://localhost:3000/api/ping)
